# Lucirion Password Manager

**Status:** ~90% Complete â€¢ No longer under active development

A secure, vault-based password manager built with Python, Tkinter, and CustomTkinter, designed for cross-platform usability and clarity. This project focuses on clean architecture, modularity, and maintainable UX patterns. My first attempt at building something like this. While development has ceased, the codebase remains a useful reference for GUI state management, persistent storage integration, and incremental feature design. However, the code is not very clean and the file structure suffers the same.

## Features

- Encrypted local vault system
- Inline editing for entry details
- Context-aware widgets and dynamic UI updates
- Explicit storage path enforcement to prevent data loss
- Modular file structure emphasizing separation of concerns
- Accessible design with scalable layout support
- TOTP (Timed-One-Time-Password) using a QR code to register

## Limitations

- No sync or cloud backup
- Mobile parity is partial due to framework constraints
- Some edge case handling still in progress

## Notes

This app is around 90% complete and **will not receive further updates or maintenance**. It's shared as-is for educational and archival purposes.
In the near future I will dedicate effort into building a new and more proper Password Manager App with the knowledge and experience I received from this project.
